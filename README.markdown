# ZK

ZK is a high-level interface to the Apache [ZooKeeper][] server. It is based on the [zookeeper gem][] which is a multi-Ruby low-level driver. Currently MRI 1.8.7 and JRuby are supported, and MRI 1.9.2 is very close to being ready. It is licensed under the [MIT][] license. 

This library is heavily used in a production deployment and is actively developed and maintained.

Development is sponsored by [Snapfish][] and has been generously released to the Open Source community by HPDC, L.P.

## What is ZooKeeper Good for?

ZooKeeper is a multi-purpose tool that is designed to allow you to write code that coordinates many nodes in a cluster. It can be used as a directory service, a configuration database, and can provide cross-cluster [locking][], [leader election][], and [group membership][] (to name a few). It presents to the user what looks like a distributed file system, with a few important differences: every node can have children _and_ data, and there is a 1MB limit on data size for any given node. ZooKeeper provides atomic semantics and a simple API for manipulating data in the heirarchy.

One of the most useful aspects of ZooKeeper is the ability to set "[watches][]" on nodes. This allows one to be notified when a node has been deleted, created, has had a child modified, or had its data modified. The asynchronous nature of these watches enables you to write code that can _react_ to changes in your environment.

ZooKeeper is also (relatively) easy to deploy in a [Highly Available][ha-config] configuration, and the clients natively understand the clustering and how to resume a session transparently when one of the cluster nodes goes away.
